# Redux-Road-Project

Thats a project in Codecademy, its about Redux, we did share data with the process of sharing and updating the state (state management).
In Redux its easier to understand when, where, why, and how in your application is being updated.
One way data flow:
1.state
2.View
and 3. actions.
